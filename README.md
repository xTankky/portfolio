# My Personal Website

Welcome !

I'm Jonathan and you are visiting the Github project of my personal Website.

## Introduction

I love programming, I have tried it in many fields such as Video Games, Web, Applications and embedded systems. What I'd like to program the most is IoT.

So now that I've finished my studies, I am looking to get a job, so in order to show my skills I've decided to build a Portfolio website using the most used and asked Framework : **ReactJS**.

I've started to learn React early September of 2020. As I knew basic Web building with HTML, CSS and JS, I wondered what React can do more. So I've watched videos, ran some tests and eventually came to an idea : this Website.

So I build it, tried to do it a professional way, started a Github project, opened VS Code and I started programming. And I loved React. I'm a huge fan of OOP programming so doing it for Web was a lovely experience.

I made this so I could use React the way it's intended to be used. I also tried to write a flexible and readable code (that I should comment one day or another).

Oh, and it should be responsive on 4 different screen types.

## Usage

This website is personal and may include not so useful things in the future. For now, this website does :
* Portfolio
* Cloud Access

What I want to add :
* Team Generator (when playing with friends)
* Tournament Generator (when playing with friends)

It is firstly made to show my skills at creating a Website.

## Project Structure
```bash
├── public (Public files such as HTML and icons)
└── src (React Folder)
    └── components
        ├── Card (Cards at the bottom of the Website)
        ├── More (More Infos page)
        ├── MyCarousel (Custom React-Responsive-Carousel)
        ├── Nav (Navbar at the top)
        └── Timeline (Full Timeline with Cards and nav arrows)
```

## React Modules
I've tried to use as little modules as possible so I can truly learn React.

* React-Router
* React-Responsive-Carousel

## Environment

* Laptop with Linux Manjaro KDE
* VS Code
* JS / CSS / HTML
* Hosted on RaspberryPi 3B

## End

Otherwise, I'll still be working on this from time to time.
